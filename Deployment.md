# Development
This website is built and designed as per client’s requirements as our client clearly mentioned in her interview that she is looking for a simple and clean website because she do not like pop ups.
The website clearly looks like image based as she does not like too much texting.
first, our client already got a domain name that she wants to link to the.com.au page. she provides a logo of her past site from where our team must choose the colours. so, for the next site maintainer, 
whenever you want to change anything, just want to remind you that you could change the font-colour but unfortunately, not the rest of coloured part of website as client specifically mention about black and tan colour for background and we just customized it a little bit by adding a background picture of leadlight after our team got her feedback as our client was happy to hear more ideas but she is strongly stick with black and tan(brown) colour for surroundings as you can see the website. while doing the CSS part, we have checked the colour combination of white, black tan like black at the back and tan on top or tan at the back and black on top. The other one looks a bit ugly so, we finalise the tan at the back with black on it. Alongside with rest of the colour choice, our team had strongly instructed to choose colours from logo only. 
Secondly, there is a menu bar on the right side of the site from where the pages can be opened as per requested. 
Thirdly, there is another link for home and garden decor which can be visit through a one clicks on it. Also, there is one more link about workshops which will open as a new page. 
Furthermore, our client did not provide any image for workshop. so, our team choose one of the images that has been provided for homepage. Moreover, there is another link named as gallery where our client has got products which is unavailable or not on homepage. The last link on homepage is about custom request where out of stock products can be requested. our team use the logo again in large size where the social-media contact can be linked. While designing this website, our team found some issues with slideshow. As a result, unable to deliver the slideshow on homepage for this website due to some WordPress site reasons. Our team tried to fix the slideshow till due date by using some plugins but can not make it work unfortunately. Furthermore, Website is easy to open in different browser as we test it successfully for all browsers. Every page has got an access to go back to home-page as demanded by the client which cannot be changed as our client strictly mentioned about it.
 
# Considerations 
- This website can be deployed in various browsers, and there are some considerations. This website is using MySQL as the database system. Thus, a persistent filesystem is required and platforms with ephemeral filesystems are not suitable.
#Project Management 
This project is using WBS to control the developing process and assign the different tasks with different team members. To develop the further functions, you need to overview the design plan on Trello Board which has been used as a staging site by our team and WBS to ensure the designed features and contents. Moreover, our team used an app named Slack as a communication tool to record the files and updates on our task which is integrated with Trello and GitHub. While integrating the Trello and GitHub, our team faced some issues to integrate Trello on slack, as a result, our team integrate slack on Trello and finally fix the issue. Furthermore, for integrating GitHub, our team follow the same pattern.
# Version Control
All the update and modification need to submit to GitHub to support the version control. Please make sure you do not update any changes and modification into the "Main Branch". All the changes need to upload into the develop branch. 
#Testing & Automation 
Please understand the testing process and standard, all the testing results must be recoded into the testing document to support the further development. 



THINGS TO CHANGE BY NEXT SITE MAINTAINER:

# By following instructions given by the client, our team successfully built a website but still there are some changes need to be done yet! For the next site maintainer, our team wants to put light on some important updates that must be done so far can be seen below:

#The slideshow for all types of products on homepage 
#Client was unable to deliver a professional picture of herself to insert on ‘about us’ page which has to be changed as soon as possible you read this note as our team use the old picture which does not suits well on page as it is not clear
# Our team use an image from gallery on “workshop’ page as there was no image based on workshop provided by the client. It needs to be changed as the image does not fit on page accordingly.
