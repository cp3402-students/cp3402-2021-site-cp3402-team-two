# Site 
This project is developing a website about Laughton Leadlight. The purpose of this website is showing the related product and gallery to the target audience. For Login information, You need to contact project manager. All the designed features and contents are related with WordPress admin panel. The developing process and related tasks are stored on https://trello.com/b/6qx8p20Y/cp3402-team-two. Our team have not used any plugin for a calendar of events, but our team use the plugins for three different pages which will be written in different pages where they have been used. Any changing requirements will be stored into the Trello Board. Except for some basic plugins that WordPress install by itself here are some plugins that our team use:
#Slideshow Gallery---- This is the plugin for the slideshow. Unfortunately, this was not working on our website.
#Theme Editor--- This is just an easy plugin that I could have a look about the code for the theme
#WP Forms Lite--- This is an easy plugin for me to create some forms on the website
