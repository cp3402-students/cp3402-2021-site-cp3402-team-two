Layout: -
For the website Laughton Leadlight, that is designed by our group conveys classic look with simplicity. This is image-based website with less text. Our team was already provided with instructions for the layout of the website by the client.
This website is easy to use. There is navigation bar on the top which leads to the different pages and those pages helps the customers to know about the services and the products that are provided by the client. This navigation bar can lead them to the products, gallery, information about the store and also contact information.
There is another bar is present on the top of the screen which helps the customers to sign up, cart and checkout. These features make it easier to use help and helps the customers to locate the information about their orders.
There are many other features on the homepage. Visitors can check the House Number signs on the homepage and buy them. There is a button named custom requests which leads them to different page where they can customize their order as well. Visitors can also locate the information about the workshops on the homepage.
When Visitor opens the product page, they can also sort them according to their choice like new arrivals, sort by popularity, sort according to price, latest products and many others. They can locate the products with their prices over there.
By Going to the contact shop, visitors can send messages to the client, or they can call to the physical shop. This increases the interaction between the customers and client which helps to build trust in customers about the products and services and products that are provided by the client.
  
We already got the logo from the client, that she wants to use for the website.

Colour:-
Client wants to use the same colours from the logo for the website, so our team decided to design the website according to it. We used the black and tan colour for the pages of the website. Firstly, black colour was used on the top bar and text was in tan colour but it was not attractive and then we decided to change it. Instead, we used the tan for the bar and black for the text which makes the text more easily readable. For the background, there is no colour because we must keep it simple as well as eye catching. Our team tried to test some colours for the background but as we were using the black and tan colour for the pages, also we have to use only those colours that are present in logo it was difficult to adjust it so we decided to give it no colour for the background. Basically, Laughton Leadlight website designed on the basis of black and tan colour. Almost all text and designing are done with the help of those two colours.
Classic and Simple: -
For giving the classic look to website, our team did not used too many colours. We used only two colours for the designing of the website. This website does not have too much text in there. Laughton Leadlight is an Image based website. Images makes it more attractive and eye catching. On the homepage, site also conveys a message about the products that are launched on the website.
Message
“Glass is about colour, but it’s also classic, old world and traditional.”
This message reflects the classic elegance of the website as well as the products on this site.
It is easy to find the details on this website because there is a menu on the top of the home page which makes it accessible to information about the services that are provided by the client. Customers can easily locate the products, gallery, contact information, about the business and place their order.

Required Improvements: -
As our client want to have slide show on the website. Our team tried to make it possible on the homepage to display the products with the help of slideshow. But we were not able to do it because sometimes it works and sometimes it was showing error. This feature needs to be added into the website.
